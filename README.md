# Moroccan-Chatbot
A chatbot is an artificial intelligence-powered piece of software in a device (Siri, Alexa, Google Assistant etc), application, website or other networks that try to gauge consumerâ€™s needs and then assist them to perform a particular task like a commercial transaction, hotel booking, form submission etc . Today almost every company has a chatbot deployed to engage with the users. By 2025, chatbots will be handling 80 percent of customer-service interactions; they are already handling about 60 percent of transactions now in differents languages. 
In our country morocco, all companies are using chatbots with Arabic or French language, but not all Moroccans speak those languages and the majority of citizens prefers to communicate with dialect Moroccan Arabic language.
So that's inspired me to make a Moroccan chatbot who can engage with users with dialect Moroccan Arabic , using cikit library and NLTK.

## But I need more time to create such a chatbot because of these points:

 - I have to make an Arabic dialect stop word file that doesn't exist in the ML scientific community.
 - 
 
   > i will continue working in this project as personal one to make it done
 
## What i have done in this project :
- i fond an arabic dialect moroccan corpus [HERE](https://nyuad.nyu.edu/en/research/centers-labs-and-projects/computational-approaches-to-modeling-language-lab/resources.html) .
